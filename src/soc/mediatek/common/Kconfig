config MEDIATEK_DRAM_ADAPTIVE
	bool

	default y
	help
	  Starting from MT8195, MediaTek platform supports "dram adaptive" to
	  automatically detect dram information, including channel, rank, die
	  size..., and can automatically configure EMI settings. So we can just
	  pass a placeholder param blob to `mt_mem_init_run` by enabling this
	  option.
	  Platforms (MT8173, MT8183, MT8192) which do not support "dram adaptive"
	  need to implement `get_sdram_config` to get the DRAM configuration info.

config MEDIATEK_DRAM_DVFS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option enables DRAM calibration with multiple frequencies (low,
	  medium and high frequency groups, with total 7 frequencies) for DVFS
	  feature. All supported data rates are: 800, 1200, 1600, 1866, 2400,
	  3200, 4266.

config MEDIATEK_DRAM_DVFS_LIMIT_FREQ_CNT
	bool
	default y
	depends on MEDIATEK_DRAM_DVFS
	help
	  This options limit DRAM frequency calibration count from total 7 to 3,
	  other frequency will directly use the low frequency shu result.

config MEDIATEK_DRAM_BLOB_FAST_INIT
	bool "Enable running fast calibration by blob"
	default n
	help
	  This option allows performing fast calibration through different
	  open-source policy.

config MEDIATEK_DRAM_SCRAMBLE
	bool "Enable DRAM scramble feature"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables DRAM data scramble, which can prevent DRAM data from
	  being hacked.

config MEMORY_TEST
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This option enables memory basic compare test to verify the DRAM read
	  or write is as expected.

config DPM_FOUR_CHANNEL
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option enables four channel configuration for DPM.

config MTK_DFD
	bool "Enable MediaTek DFD (Design For Debug) settings"
	help
	  DFD (Design for Debug) is a debugging tool, which scans flip-flops
	  and dumps to internal RAM on the WDT reset. We reserve 1MB on DRAM
	  to store logs of DFD.

config USE_CBMEM_DRAM_INFO
	bool "Support filling dram information to cbmem"
	help
	  The DRAM initialization will keep and return DRAM information (size,
	  geometry and other DDR info) so we can fill that into the CBMEM.

config FLASH_DUAL_IO_READ
	bool
	default n
	help
	  When this option is enabled, the flash controller provides the ability
	  to dual IO read mode.

config PWRAP_WITH_PMIF_SPMI
	bool
	default n
	help
	  When this option is enabled, the PMIC interface only supports PWRAP
	  and PMIF_SPMI.

config PMIF_SPMI_IOCFG_DEFAULT_SETTING
	bool
	default n
	help
	  For SoCs where IO pins default to PMIF_SPMI mode, enable this option
	  to skip software PMIF_SPMI IO pins configuration.

config DEVAPC_DEBUG
	bool
	default n
	help
	  When this option is enabled, the DEVAPC driver prints the settings after
	  initialization.

config EARLY_MMU_INIT
	bool
	default n
	help
	  When this option is enabled, `mtk_mmu_init()` will be done in
	  `bootblock_soc_early_init()` to reduce the boot time.
