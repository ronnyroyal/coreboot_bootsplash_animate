	  PCI config offset 0x18 point to LMEMBAR and need to add GTT size to
	  reach at DSM which is referred here as SOC_INTEL_GFX_MEMBASE_OFFSET.
	  SoC that follow such design would override SOC_INTEL_GFX_FRAMEBUFFER_OFFSET
	  with GTT_SIZE value. On SoC platform where PCI config offset 0x18 points
	  to the GMADR directly can use the default value 0x0 without any override.

config SOC_INTEL_GFX_MBUS_JOIN
	bool
	help
	  The MBUS (Memory Bus) is a high-speed interface that connects the graphics
	  controller to the system memory. It provides a dedicated data path for graphics
	  data, which helps to improve graphics performance.

	  The MBUS is a key technology that helps to make the Intel i915 driver powerful
	  and versatile graphics drivers available. It provides the high-speed data transfer
	  capabilities that are essential for smooth and responsive graphics performance.

	  Enable this config to ensure that the Intel GFX controller joins the MBUS before the
	  i915 driver is loaded. This is necessary to prevent the i915 driver from re-initializing
	  the display if the firmware has already initialized it. Without this config, the i915
	  driver will initialize the display to bring up the login screen although the firmware
	  has initialized the display using the GFX MMIO registers and framebuffer.

	  When enabled, saves 75ms-80ms of the boot time by avoiding redundent display
	  initialization by kernel graphics driver (i.e., i915_gfx).
