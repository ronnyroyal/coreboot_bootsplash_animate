	  Enable USB-C operations via the EC. Requires `usbc_get_ops` to control features
	  such as HPD and DP Mode entry. Currently, only the ChromeEC implements this, see
	  (ec/google/chromeec/usbc_mux.c).

	  This results in the MUX being set to a disabled state.

	  Enable USB-C attached storage devices to be detected at boot.
	  This option is required for some payloads (eg, edk2), without which devices attached
	  to USB-C ports will not be detected and available to boot from.
