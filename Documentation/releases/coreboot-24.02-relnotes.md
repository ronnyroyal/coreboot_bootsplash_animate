coreboot 24.02 release
========================================================================

The coreboot project is happy to announce our release for February
2024. Over the past three months, our contributors have focused on
refining the coreboot codebase, generally prioritizing cleanup and
quality enhancements. We extend our gratitude to all the contributors
who have dedicated their time and expertise. Thank you for your
invaluable contributions to this vital phase of maintenance and
optimization.

The next release is scheduled for mid-May.


### Release number format update

The previous release was the last to use the incrementing 4.xx release
name scheme. For this and future releases, coreboot has switched to a
Year.Month.Sub-version naming scheme. As such, the next release,
scheduled for May of 2024 will be numbered 24.05, with the sub-version
of 00 implied. If we need to do a fix or incremental release, we'll
append the values .01, .02 and so on to the initial release value.


### The master branch is being deleted

The coreboot project changed from master to main roughly 6 months ago,
and has been keeping the two branches in sync since then to ease the
transition. As of this release, we are getting rid of the master branch
completely. Please make sure any scripts you're using that reference the
'master' branch have been switched to 'main'.


Release 24.02.1
---------------

### lib/rtc: Fix off-by-one error in February day count in leap year

The month argument passed to rtc\_month\_days is 0-based, not 1-based.
This results in the RTC being reverted to the build date constantly
on 29th February 2024.


Significant or interesting changes
----------------------------------

### acpi: Add Arm IO Remapping Table structures

Input Output Remapping Table (IORT) represents the IO topology of an Arm
based system.

Document number: ARM DEN 0049E.e, Sep 2022


### acpi: Add PPTT support

This patch adds code to generate Processor Properties Topology Tables
(PPTT) compliant to the ACPI 6.4 specification.

 - The 'acpi_get_pptt_topology' hook is mandatory once ACPI_PPTT is
   selected. Its purpose is to return a pointer to a topology tree,
   which describes the relationship between CPUs and caches. The hook
   can be provided by, for example, mainboard code.

Background: We are currently working on mainboard code for qemu-sbsa and
Neoverse N2. Both require a valid PPTT table. Patch was tested against
the qemu-sbsa board.


### acpi: Add support for WDAT table

This commit lays the groundwork for implementing the ACPI WDAT (Watchdog
Action Table) table specification. The WDAT is a special ACPI table
introduced by Microsoft that describes the watchdog for the OS.

Platforms that need to implement the WDAT table must describe the
hardware watchdog management operations as described in the
specification. See “Links to ACPI-Related Documents”
(http://uefi.org/acpi) under the heading “Watchdog Action Table”.


### lib/jpeg: Replace decoder with Wuffs' implementation

To quote its repo[0]: Wuffs is a memory-safe programming language (and a
standard library written in that language) for Wrangling Untrusted File
Formats Safely. Wrangling includes parsing, decoding and encoding.

It compiles its library, written in its own language, to a C/C++ source
file that can then be used independently without needing support for the
language. That library is now imported to src/vendorcode/wuffs/.

This change modifies our linters to ignore that directory because it's
supposed to contain the wuffs compiler's result verbatim.

Nigel Tao provided an initial wrapper around wuffs' jpeg decoder that
implements our JPEG API. I further changed it a bit regarding data
placement, dropped stuff from our API that wasn't ever used, or isn't
used anymore, and generally made it fit coreboot a bit better. Features
are Nigel's, bugs are mine.

This commit also adapts our jpeg fuzz test to work with the modified
API. After limiting it to deal only with approximately screen sized
inputs, it fuzzed for 25 hours CPU time without a single hang or crash.
This is a notable improvement over running the test with our old decoder
which crashes within a minute.

Finally, I tried the new parser with a pretty-much-random JPEG file I
got from the internet, and it just showed it (once the resolution
matched), which is also a notable improvement over the old decoder which
is very particular about the subset of JPEG it supports.

In terms of code size, a QEmu build's ramstage increases
from 128060 bytes decompressed (64121 bytes after LZMA)
  to 172304 bytes decompressed (82734 bytes after LZMA).
